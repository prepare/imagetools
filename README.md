.NET Image Tools

ImageTools for Silverlight is a library, which provides additional functionality for loading, saving and manipulation images from different sources and with different formats.

At the moment the library is able to load the most important png, jpg, bmp and gif formats. Please have a look at the following demo and select a image which should be displayed. If an error messages appears this means, that the file is not supported yet and I would very happy for a comment with the image attached, which you used for testing.
